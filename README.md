This repository is a complement to the paper *Three-dimensional nonlinear soil–structure interactionfor Rayleigh wave incidence in layered soils* (2022) published in the **Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics**. 

The **TML-DRM method** is implemented in a Python script for generation of SV (shear-wave) and RH (Rayleigh-wave). The provided scripts are

## SV.py
- The script has the functions required to produce a SV wave a in 2D layered media\n
- The script will produce the following animation ![SV wave](SV.gif)

## RH.py
- The script has the functions required to produce a SV wave a in 2D layered media
- The script will produce the following animation ![SV wave](SV.gif)
